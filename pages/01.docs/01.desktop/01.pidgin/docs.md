> Pidgin (formerly named Gaim) is a free and open-source multi-platform instant messaging client, based on a library named libpurple that has support for many instant messaging protocols, allowing the user to simultaneously log in to various services from one application.

## Connecting

Pidgin users can connect a KodeNet Jabber ID with the following steps.

1. Upon starting up Pidgin for the first time users will be presented with the following dialog. 
![Pidgin](/user/pages/media/pidgin/connect/step1.png)
2. After clicking **Add** the XMPP protocol must be selected. The *Username* field should only contain the first part of the Jabber ID without @domain since Pidgin requires the domain in a spearate field. **Resource* can be anything like _Home_ or _Work_. In the example I chose _Pidgin_.![Pidgin](/user/pages/media/pidgin/connect/step2.png)

The XMPP/Jabber account should now show Online.

>>>>> By default newly connected accounts will see a **Support** contact in the roster list. This contact is not required to have and can be removed or re-added at anytime. This contact is simply available for questions and assistance.
