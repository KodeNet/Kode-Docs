> Jitsi (formerly SIP Communicator) is a free and open source multiplatform voice (VoIP), videoconferencing and instant messaging application for Windows, Linux, macOS and Android. It supports several popular instant-messaging and telephony protocols, including open recognised encryption protocols for chat (OTR) and voice/video/streaming and voice/video conferencing (SIP/RTP/SRTP/ZRTP), as well as built-in IPv6, NAT traversal and DNSSEC.

## Connecting
Get connected with [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) to start audio and video chat conferences with family, friends and co-workers. 

>>>>> The [Jitsi Meet](https://goo.gl/cR4Vgh) Android app does not require an account to start audio and video conferences.

1. Select **Add new account...** from file menu.

>>>>>While the demonstrated steps are on macOS, the Jitsi desktop user interface is very much identical across operating systems.

2. Select **XMPP** from the `Network` dropdown menu.

The account should now show it is connected and online in the displayed user roster. Those on Jitsi can begin audio and video conferencing including many other XMPP features.

>>>>> By default newly connected accounts will see a **Support** contact in the roster list. This contact is not required to have and can be removed or re-added at anytime. This contact is simply available for questions and assistance.
