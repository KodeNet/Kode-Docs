> ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OTR encryption over XMPP. Unlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more.

## Connecting

ChatSecure users can connect a KodeNet Jabber ID with the following steps.

1. The following screen will be presented when launching ChatSecure for the first time. This is completely optional.

2. The second screen allows a Google Talk account to be added, but we won't be doing this now. Simply swipe to the next screen for XMPP/Jabber.

3. We can finally tap **ADD ACCOUNT** for XMPP/Jabber.

4. Enter the KodeNet Jabber ID username and password created during registration. It is not required to set anything special in **ADVANCED ACCOUNT SETTINGS**. Skip to step 6 once signed in.

7. Tapping anywhere in the conversations screen will then show the buddy (or roster) list.

>>>>> By default newly connected accounts will see a **Support** contact in the roster list. This contact is not required to have and can be removed or re-added at anytime. This contact is simply available for questions and assistance.
