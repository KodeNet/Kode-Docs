> Conversations is a Jabber/XMPP client for Android 4.0+ smartphones that has been optimized to provide a unique mobile experience.

[Conversations](https://goo.gl/3vaYZP) is the technology leader in mobile XMPP instant messaging. This is the recommended XMPP/Jabber client for Android mobile devices featuring [XEP-0384 OMEMO](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html), a state of the art multi-end-to-multi-end encryption method which is very easy to setup and gives you forward secrecy and plausible deniability. For backwards compatibility reasons Conversations also supports OTR and OpenPGP.

KodeNet XMPP/Jabber users can connect with Conversations following these simple steps.

## Connecting
1. Tap `Manage accounts` from the upper-right corner of the Conversations window.

The account should now show it is connected and online in the displayed user roster. 

>>>>>>When tapping `Manage Accounts` to list your connected account, you can then tap your account and the 3 vertical dots in the upper-right of the device to be presented with additional options. From those options you can select the `Server info` box to have Conversations display some features available in the current connected session.
