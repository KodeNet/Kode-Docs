_Xabber is an open-source XMPP client for Android. It supports multiple XEPs, Off-The-Record (OTR) chat encryption and is available in multiple languages. Xabber is built around open source standards, interoperability, design and user experience._

>>>Xabber has no plans to support OMEMO encryption and refers to those seeking privacy as [_junkies_ and _crypto-nerds_](https://github.com/redsolution/xabber-android/issues/540#issuecomment-334995574) in addition to other wild assumptions. KodeNet values user privacy and therefore would not recommend this client.

## Connecting

Xabber users can connect a KodeNet Jabber ID with the following steps.

1. Tap **ADD ACCOUNT** after launching Xabber for the first time.
