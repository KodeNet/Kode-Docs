## Register
There are a couple ways a new user can register a KodeNet Jabber account to begin chatting with friends, family, co-workers or anyone who needs a way to communicate via secure Instant Messaging.

##### In-band
Per [XEP-0077](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html)

> In-band registration must make it possible for an entity to register with a host, cancel an existing registration with a host, or change a password with a host.

The convenience of in-band registration is that a user may register an account using an Instant Messaging client provided it supports the XMPP protocol.

KodeNet features an integrated free and open-source XMPP chat client powered by [converse.js](https://conversejs.org/). On the [KodeNet website](https://www.koderoot.net) users will notice a **Toggle chat** tab at the bottom of the page. Once the web client is open there will be two tabs - one to **Sign in** and one to **Register**.

Available KodeNet domains `im.koderoot.net` or `kode.im` can be entered in the **Register** tab followed by **Fetch registration form**.

##### Web Page
KodeNet XMPP also has an available web registration page allowing registration on the following domains:

+ [im.koderoot.net](https://im.koderoot.net/register-on-im.koderoot.net)
+ [kode.im](https://im.koderoot.net/register-on-kode.im) 

New registrations must complete a required CAPTCHA in an attempt to fight off spammers and determine whether or not the user is human.
