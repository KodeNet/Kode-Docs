>Discord is a proprietary freeware VoIP application designed for gaming communities. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in a web browser. Discord lets you can stay connected to all your Discord voice and text chat channels even while AFK. It is perfect for chatting with team members, seeing who is playing online, and catching up on text conversations you may have missed.

KodeNet uses the [discord-irc](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc) project to connect KodeNet's Discord and IRC channels which allows sending messages back and forth between both networks.

## Connecting
>>>>>> [Create a Discord account](https://discordapp.com/register)

Discord users can connect to the KodeNet Discord server with an [invite](https://discord.gg/HCzScbX) or by joining as a _Guest_ using the embedded Discord chat found at the bottom of this page. Once you join there is nothing further that needs to be done. Simply send messages from KodeNet's Discord or [IRC network](https://www.koderoot.net/docs/irc/info). Messages between both networks will be sent and received as one unified network.
