To view connected buddies:

blist - List all the buddies in the current channel

Syntax: 

blist [all|online|offline|away] [<pattern>]
You can get a more readable buddy list using the blist command. If you want a complete list (including the offline users) you can use the all argument.

A perl-compatible regular expression can be supplied as pattern to filter the results (case-insensitive).
